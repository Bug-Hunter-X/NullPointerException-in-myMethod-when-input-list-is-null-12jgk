# Groovy NullPointerException Bug
This repository demonstrates a common NullPointerException in Groovy when dealing with lists. The `myMethod` function fails to properly handle a null or empty input list, resulting in a runtime exception.

## Bug Description
The `myMethod` function is supposed to process a list of strings. However, if the input list is null or empty, it throws a NullPointerException instead of returning an appropriate default value (e.g., an empty list).

## Solution
The solution involves explicitly checking for null or empty lists before attempting to access their elements. This prevents the NullPointerException and ensures the function behaves correctly in all cases.
